This repository contains Python source code for LDDMM registration

You are welcome to use it, but note that it is provided without guarantee or maintenance commitment. 
As you can guess, the younes-work branch is my working repository, and as such is completely unreliable. 
Please only use the master branch, even though it may only be slightly more manageable.

py-lddmm: python code for surface and curve matching running python2.7 and using PIL (pillow) and vtk6 (or vtk7) python libraries (more details to come)
py-metamorphosis: python code for metamorphosis (python2.7, PIL, vtk, fortran libraries). Co-written by Casey Richardson
diffeoReg: Old C++ code for image matching (LDDMM and metamorphosis)

To compile f90 programs in py-lddmm
f2py3 --f90flags='-fopenmp' -lgomp -c kernelFunctions.f90 -m kernelFunctions_fort
f2py3 --f90flags='-fopenmp' -lgomp -c pointEvolution.f90 -m pointEvolution_fort
