This repository contains Python source code for LDDMM registration

You are welcome to use it, but note that it is provided without guarantee or maintenance commitment. 
As you can guess, the younes-work branch is my working repository, and as such is completely unreliable. 
Please only use the master branch, even though it may only be slightly more manageable.
